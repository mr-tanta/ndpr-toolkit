# Installation Test Results for @tantainnovative/ndpr-toolkit v1.0.5

## ✅ Installation Success
- **npm install**: Successfully installed with npm
- **pnpm install**: Successfully installed with pnpm

## ⚠️ Package Structure Issue
The package was published with the entire project structure instead of just the library. This means:

### Current Import Path (Incorrect):
```javascript
// This doesn't work:
import { ConsentBanner } from '@tantainnovative/ndpr-toolkit';
```

### Working Import Path:
```javascript
// This works:
const toolkit = require('@tantainnovative/ndpr-toolkit/packages/ndpr-toolkit/dist/index.js');
```

## 📋 What's Included
The package correctly excludes:
- ✅ CLAUDE.md (not in package)
- ✅ .claude directory (not in package)
- ✅ .github directory (not in package)
- ✅ .husky directory (not in package)

But includes unnecessary files:
- ❌ Next.js app files (src/app)
- ❌ Demo pages
- ❌ Development configuration files

## 🔧 Recommendation for Next Release
The package.json needs to be restructured to only publish the library from `packages/ndpr-toolkit` directory, not the entire monorepo structure.

## 🧪 Test Results
1. **CommonJS Import**: ✅ Works with full path
2. **ESM Import**: ❌ Fails due to missing package.json exports
3. **TypeScript Types**: ✅ Available in dist directory
4. **File Size**: 614.5 kB (could be smaller with correct structure)
