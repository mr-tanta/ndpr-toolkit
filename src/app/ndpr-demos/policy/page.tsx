We may share your personal data with the following categories of third parties:

{{{dataRecipients}}}
{{else}}
We do not share personal data with third parties beyond what is necessary for basic website functionality.

### Safeguards for Third-Party Transfers

We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

### International Transfers

{{#if transfersDataInternationally}}
We may transfer your personal data to countries outside Nigeria. When we do, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to your personal data by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

- We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data.
- Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved for use in Nigeria which give personal data the same protection it has in Nigeria.
- Where we transfer data to the United States or other regions, we may use specific certification mechanisms or obtain your consent for the transfer.

Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of Nigeria.

### How Long We Keep Your Personal Data

{{#if collectsPersonalData}}
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

Our standard retention period for personal data is: {{dataRetentionPeriod}}

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
{{else}}
We do not retain personal data beyond what is necessary for basic website functionality.
{{/if}}

### Data Deletion

When your personal data is no longer required for the purposes for which it was collected, we will delete or anonymize it. If this is not possible (for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

### Data Minimization

We practice data minimization, which means we only collect and process the personal data that is necessary for the purposes for which it is collected. We regularly review our data collection practices to ensure we are not collecting more data than necessary.`,
