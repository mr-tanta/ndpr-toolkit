          <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
            Organizations must process personal data lawfully, fairly, and transparently. This means having a valid legal 
            basis for processing, such as consent, contract, legal obligation, vital interests, public interest, or 
            legitimate interests.

          <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
            When relying on consent as the legal basis for processing, organizations must ensure that consent is freely given, 
            specific, informed, and unambiguous. Consent must be obtained through a clear affirmative action and must be as 
            easy to withdraw as it is to give.
