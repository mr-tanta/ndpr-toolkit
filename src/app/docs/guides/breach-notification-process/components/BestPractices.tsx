            <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 text-sm">
              don&apos;t wait for a breach to occur before developing your response plan. Have templates, 
              procedures, and roles defined in advance so you can respond quickly when a breach happens.

            <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 text-sm">
              Ensure that all staff members know how to identify and report a potential data breach.

            <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 text-sm">
              Maintain detailed records of all breaches, including those that don&apos;t require notification. 
              Document the facts of the breach, its effects, and the remedial actions taken. This is a requirement under the NDPR.

            <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 text-sm">
              Develop clear criteria for determining when a breach requires notification to NITDA and/or data subjects. 
              This helps ensure consistent decision-making and compliance with the NDPR.

            <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 text-sm">
              Involve legal counsel in the development of your breach notification process and in the review of 
              notifications before they are sent. This helps ensure that your notifications meet legal requirements.

            <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 text-sm">
              Regularly test your breach notification process through tabletop exercises or simulations. 
              This helps identify and address any weaknesses in your process before a real breach occurs.

            <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 text-sm">
              After each breach, conduct a post-incident review to identify lessons learned and opportunities for improvement. 
              Update your breach notification process based on these insights.

          <li>
            <strong>Delayed Response:</strong> Failing to act quickly once a breach is detected. Remember, the 72-hour clock 
            starts ticking as soon as you become aware of the breach.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Incomplete Notifications:</strong> Omitting required information from breach notifications, such as the 
            nature of the breach, likely consequences, or measures taken.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Inadequate Documentation:</strong> Failing to maintain detailed records of the breach and your response, 
            which are required under the NDPR.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Poor Communication:</strong> Not communicating clearly with affected data subjects about the breach and 
            what they should do to protect themselves.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Neglecting Follow-up:</strong> Failing to follow up on remedial actions or to provide additional information 
            to NITDA as it becomes available.
